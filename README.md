## How to add notes (blog posts)

Add note data in file in *notes/content* folder with name without extension.

Add index record in *notes/content/index.json* file.

Use my [blog-post-transformer](https://github.com/fedor-rusak/blog-post-transformer) to regenerate content, latest and your new post.

Enjoy!
